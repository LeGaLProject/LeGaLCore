## About the Proposed Acivity

In this experiment, we conducted a usability experiment with NCL specialists to measure the ease of use of our extension with developers who already know the main elements of NCL. We invite the testers to perform two activities.

First activity: The player would visit three places, in each place the player visualizes a media. The game ends when the player visits the third location.

- Church: a video
- Hospital: a image
- Park: a AR object

Second activity: The game has two teams (A and B), in which each team consists of a player. Team A should visit the church and then the castle. Team B should visit the hospital and then the castle. Whoever arrives first in the castle wins the game.

- Church: a image
- Hospital: a audio
- Castelo: a video
